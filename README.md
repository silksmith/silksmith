Compile your JS code with Google's Closure Compiler, generate CSS with SASS. Build it with Gradle!

##Concept
- Package JS and SCSS
- Compile JS (type checking)
- Compile Sass (scss)
- Build-in Dev/Test server
- Nothing needed on the build server, Gradle comes with everything (no node/npm/bower etc. must be installed or executed in the beginning)

##Contributing
There are still not that many silk packages especially that contain a full externs coverage, it would be great if people would create more silk packages! :)
